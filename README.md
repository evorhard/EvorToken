# EvorToken

## About the Project

Utilizing the frameworks provided by [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) for smart contract testing and development, alongside the contracts from [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), EvorToken is both a learning exercise and trying to build a very robust token on my own.

## Project Status

- **Current Phase:** Early Development
- **Focus Areas:** Token creation, contract security, and learning best practices in smart contract development.
- **Technologies Used:** Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin.

## Setting Up the Project

_Will be expounded upon when the project is done._

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Foundry for the incredible tooling and OpenZeppelin for their pre-made contracts.
